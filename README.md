# lane-Video-Detection
Lane line detection is one of the essential components of self-driving cars. There are many approaches to doing this. Here, weâ€™ll look at the simplest approach using Hough Transform.
# Lane Detection in OpenCV
This algorithm can detect straight lane lines in both videos and images
